#To select rows whose column value is in an iterable array, which we'll define as array, you can use isin:
array = ['yellow', 'green']
df.loc[df['favorite_color'].isin(array)]

#To select rows whose column value equals a scalar, some_value, use ==:
df.loc[df['favorite_color'] == 'yellow']

#To select a row based on multiple conditions you can use &:
array = ['yellow', 'green']
df.loc[(df['age'] == 21) & df['favorite_color'].isin(array)]

#To select rows where a column value does not equal a value, use !=:
df.loc[df['favorite_color'] != 'yellow']

#To return a rows where column value is not in an iterable array, use ~ in front of df:
array = ['yellow', 'green']
df.loc[~df['favorite_color'].isin(array)]
